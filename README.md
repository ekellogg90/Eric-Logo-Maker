## Description

- What problem does this solve: This Logo generator solves the problem of having to spend time designing a logo or hiring an outside party to accomplish it
- What I learned: Creating this was a huge lesson in inheritance and how to proberly use classes
- Challanges: TDD is still something I'm working on wrapping my head around.
